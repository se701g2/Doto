# Doto's Code of Conduct

The following code of conduct outlines the expectations for participation in the open-source community managed by Doto, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. 

At Doto, we are committed to providing a welcoming, open, diverse, inclusive and healthy workspace for everyone. 

Any individual violating this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to capture our common understanding of a productive, collaborative environment. We expect the code to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

## Standards

As a part of the Doto community we will:

  - **Be patient and friendly:** Remember that you might not be communicating in someone else's primary 
  spoken or programming language and others may not have your level of understanding.

  - **Be welcoming:** Doto welcomes and supports people from all backgrounds and communities. This includes but is not limited to the level of experience, education, socio-economic status, visible or invisible disability, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual identity, and orientation or gender identity. 

  - **Be respectful:** As developers of the Doto community, we conduct ourselves professionally and practice acceptance and tolerance. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. Doto defines disrespectful and unacceptable behavior to be:
    - Belittling anyone's experience 
    - Violent threats or language
    - Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language
    - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    - Posting, or threatening to post, people's personally identifying information
    - Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.
    - Behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention
    - Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.

  - **Demonstrate empathy and kindness toward other people:** At Doto we promote empathy as it helps us make more informed decisions as developers. We should also not taunt others or be show anger. It doesn't help anyone when we furiously tell others what they do is wrong and that they shouldnâ€™t be doing what they are doing.
  
  - **Take constructive criticism:** Disagreements, both social and technical, are useful learning opportunities. Seek to understand the other viewpoints and resolve differences constructively. Give and gracefully accept constructive feedback.

  - **Focus on team rather than self:** Great results come from working together towards the same goal, 
  not by working yourself towards your goal. 

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Everyone who belongs to Doto should be practicing this code and making sure that no one else is violating it. However, community leaders are responsible for clarifying these standards
of acceptable behavior wherever the line is unclear. They will also take appropriate action for any behavior that they deem unaligned with this code. 

Community leaders have the right to remove, edit, or reject, comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this code of conduct, and will communicate the reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate. 

## Scope
This code of conduct applies within all community spaces including issues and pull requests, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. These public spaces include using the official email address or delivering presentations to an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassment or otherwise unacceptable behavior that breaks this code may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. If you encounter such behavior please inform us by emailing **se701group2@gmail.com**.

In your email please include:

- Your contact information.
- Names of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well.
- Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public chat log), please include a link or attachment.
- Any additional information that may be helpful.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

The following is a detailed outline of the steps of enforcement when the code is broken.

  **1. Correction**

Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.
